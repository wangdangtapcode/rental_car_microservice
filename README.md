## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hungdn1701/microservices-assignment-starter.git
   cd microservices-assignment-starter
   ```

2. **Copy environment file**

   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Run with Docker Compose**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## 🧪 Development Notes

- Use `docs/api-specs/*.yaml` to document REST APIs using OpenAPI format (Swagger).

---

## 📚 Recommended Tasks
- [ ] Document system analysis and design in `analysis-and-design.md` as the first step
- [ ] Update `architecture.md` to describe your system components.
- [ ] Define all APIs using OpenAPI YAML in `docs/api-specs/`.
- [ ] Implement business logic in `service-a` and `service-b`.
- [ ] Configure API Gateway
- [ ] Ensure services can communicate internally using service names (Docker Compose handles networking).

---

## 📌 Notes

- Use Git branches for team collaboration.
- Commit early, commit often!

---

## 👩‍🏫 Assignment Submission

Please make sure:
- `README.md` is updated with service descriptions and API usage, following standard README conventions (e.g., clear structure, usage instructions, and contribution guidelines).
- Include a list of team members and their contributions in the `README.md`.
- All your code should be **runnable with one command**: `docker-compose up`.
